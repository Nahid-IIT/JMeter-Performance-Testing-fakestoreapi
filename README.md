Dear,

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App https://fakestoreapi.com.
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://fakestoreapi.com.

- 25 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 13 And Total Concurrent API requested: 780.
- 27 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 12 And Total Concurrent API requested: 728.
- 28 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 12 And Total Concurrent API requested: 702


#### While executed 28 concurrent request, found 1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.14%.
## Summary: 
Server can handle almost concurrent 27 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
